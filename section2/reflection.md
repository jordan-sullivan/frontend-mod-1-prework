## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I find that I wait too long to ask questions. I am naturally a curious person so I try to figure things out on my own first, but I tend to wait too long before I realize I need help. This article reminded me to reach out sooner! I need to get into the habit of pin-pointing where I am lost and asking for clear help using code snippets, etc to move forward.  

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
I did have to refer to my notes from time to time and Google a few things, but I think the realization hit me that I need to commit some of these syntaxes and commands to memory to be able to move forward. I am feeling more comfortable-especially with if/else statements, but know I still need more practice.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use
Conditional statements help determine which script a computer program should follow. A daily life conditional would be: If I finish all my Mod 1 Prework, then I can go to the party. `if` I do not finish, I will need to skip the party and finish my homework. In a web application: `if` there are enough funds in Person's bank account after swiping debit card, they can purchase item. `else`, the transaction will be declined.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
By writing `else` , we are headed down the "bad" path. If we need to travel further down that path to get to a resolution, `else if (condition2)` and so on can help provide another condition until met.

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
Logical operators can check that multiple conditions are met before moving on to the next code block. The `&&` operator allows 2 or more statements to have to be evaluated to `true` and the `||` operator allows an `or` expression so that one or more have to be evalutated to `true` to run.

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
How detailed do we need to be about conditionals. Will a program know all the letters if I were to be general and say `else if (not recognized as a letter)` or do I need to list all the letters?
