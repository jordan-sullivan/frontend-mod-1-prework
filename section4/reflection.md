## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
* My work happened mostly at night after my full time job, so breaks were appreciated!! I did notice it is hard to get back into it for me and remember what code I was looking into, etc, so I had to adjust to longer work chunks with the same break times. Seemed much better.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
* I found that it was incredibly hard for me to guess how long something might take me. For the exercises, I tried to split them in to 2-3 parts and break often, but i had to end up only taking 1-2 breaks per exercise because it was so hard to get back into the flow of things otherwise.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
* An object is a grouping of elements that can be manipulated in several different ways and has dynamic outputs for each instance created. Arrays typically are not manipulated and act more as a listing of elements.  

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class (Array, students remain the same in class usually )
  * List of states and their capitals (Array, states and capitals would not change)
  * List of things to pack for vacation( Array, just a list)
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow (Object, there are more details that could change more frequently)
  * List of student names and their cohort( Object, the students have their own information each )
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake( Object since there is more than one main poece of information for each element)
  * All my favorite restaurants (Object, multiple data points could be stored here)

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
* Google MAPS would have quite a lot of objects. Some examples of key-pairs might include:
class Directions {
constructor(Cuppa Joe's, 245.5, Zippy Chargers, 97.3) {
this.nearbyCoffeeShops = "Cuppa Joe's"
this.nearestMainCityMiles = 245.5
this.electricCarChargerStations = "Zippy Chargers"
this.reccommendedRadioStations = 97.3
}
 }

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
* Classes are still not clear to me completely. Choosing the values within constructor methods are difficult to select. I would love a list to choose from. I'm also unsure about the banking syntax that was referenced in the lesson, the "transaction item object".
