## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
* The SuperLearner Article was interesting. I related to the "learning is a process" section. It has been helpful to remember that learning is all about the *journey*, not the destination. I have really tried to take my time and understand the "why" behind things in this course rather than rush through to try to get an assignment done. 

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

     ##### Number/Integer Data Types
     * Handle all numbers, both negative and positive. Floating point numbers have a decimal in them, and larger numbers shoulf not include a comma. 

     ##### String Data Types
     * Can consist of letters, characters, and/or numbers. These are all wrapped in single or double quotes as long as they are same on both side. 

     ##### Boolean Data Types
     * Evaluates to either true or false only. Helps to determine which script a program should run. 


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
* A variable is like a labeled container that can store several different items or values inside of it.
```javascript
var mixedNutTypes = "almonds";
mixedNUtTypes = "peanuts";
mixedNutTypes = "cashews";
mixedNutTypes = "walnuts"; 
alert(s);
```

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
* In my Chase bank app, they most likely use:
```javascript
var = accountHolderName; \\ String
var = checkingBalance; \\ Integer
var = savingsBalance; \\ Integer
alert(s);
```
               
7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
* In JavaScript, Concatenation is an operating method used to join variables and strings together using the '+' operator.  

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
* It seems concatention is used quite often to diplay a result to a user. Examples: *"Jordan, you have 172 days left until your birthday on October 13th!"* for a birthday countdown app, or on the Chase bank app, *"Jordan, you are 67% on your way to meeting your savings goal of $1,900!"* 

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
* Not 100% confident on `console.log` back and forth between terminal / atom . 
* What is the difference between inline and reference links when we are adding links in MarkDown ?
