## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* Reading that mistakes are not only part of learning, but "essential" to it is comforting! There has been a pretty steep learning curve for me so far, and I was shocked as well as delighted to read that section in the blog post by Kristin Villanueva. Focusing and reflecting on what I have learned, iterated, and scripted has been the best part. When I can see how something can work, and why- I am totally interested. Learning that reevaluating and reflecting on what I have done can make me a better programmer really resonated with me.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
* So far, I have currently been improving my ZPD (Zone of Proximal Development) as I have had to push myself in nearly every task I have completed. Nothing so far has come easy or natural to me. In this way, I've been demonstrating a Growth Mindset, as I navigate outside of my repertoire. I need to work on asking for help more in a specific way, and work on detailing the best proper and specific way to do so. I would like to compare code more often and read other people's as well as creating "SMART"er goals for myself.

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
* An Online flowershop lists it's bouquet options on main page with photos and descriptions.
"Sunrise Bloom", "Blue Flower Lagoon", "Roses the Riveter". The Same flowershop website lists
an array of the different size options and prices for the selected bouquet.
$40.99, 6$0.99, $80.99]; Once selected, user will need to follow steps in another list before checking out:
checkout process, customer details, proceed to payment, etc.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
* An array method is just a way to list elements together under one variable. Arrays can include string, integers, booleans, etc.  

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
* The purpose of a loop is to save time for the developer so they do not have to manually run code or output items to the console.log. You could use a loopy with an array when checking items in a list for a certain attribute. You could use a loop without an array to print integers or messages. 

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
* Loops go step by step checking if information it true. If the information is true the program keeps going until it hits a roadblock then stops and lets you know when.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
* Interested to know more about the while loops, etc. rather than just for loops.
