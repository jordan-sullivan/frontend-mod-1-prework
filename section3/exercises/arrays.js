//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe ", "Elephant"];

console.log(animals.length);


// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
animals.splice(2, 1, "Gorilla");
console.log(animals);

var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
animals[2] = "Gorilla"
console.log(animals)


// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Gorilla"];
animals[3] = "Penguin";
console.log(animals)

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant", "Penguin"];
console.log(animals[2])



//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ["carrot", "beet", "plum", "bread"]

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
var foods = ["carrot", "beet", "plum", "bread"];
console.log(foods.length)


// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
var foods = ["carrot", "beet", "plum", "bread"];
foods[4] = "broccoli";
console.log(foods)


// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
var foods = ["carrot", "beet", "plum", "bread", "broccoli"];
foods.pop();
console.log(foods)



// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
var foods = ["carrot", "beet", "plum", "bread"];
console.log(foods.unshift("potato", "kiwifruit", "pasta"))
console.log(foods)

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
var foods = ["potato", "kiwifruit", "pasta", "carrot", "beet", "plum", "bread"];
console.log(foods.shift())
console.log(foods)


//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Online flowershop lists it's bouquet options on main page with photos and descriptions.
var bouquetOptions = ["Sunrise Bloom", "Blue Flower Lagoon", "Roses the Riveter"];

// 2: Same flowershop website lists an array of the different size options and prices for the selected bouquet.
var sunriseBloomPrices = [40.99, 60.99, 80.99];

// 3: Once selected, user will need to follow steps in another list before checking out:
var checkoutProcess = ["check customer details", "proceed to payment", "choose shipping info"];


//-------------------
// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
They can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here
//Select message to write if user has greater than or equal to 15% battery left
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15){
//Write the following message onto the console
  console.log("You can call an Uber!");
//If user meets BOTH logical operators they may
//receive a message stating they can take an uber..
} else if (hasCharger === true && chargerType === "car"){
//Display following meaasge to user
  console.log("You have the right charger and can call an Uber!")
//If either the boolean value is false OR string does not strictly equal "car"
// print a message saying they cannot take an uber.
} else if (hasCharger !== true || chargerType !== "car");
// print the following message to the console
  console.log("Looks like you're walking home buddy.")




// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
